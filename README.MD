Probably will not receive updates because it meets all the requirements for the lucky tuesday event.

## I have doubts 

RANDOM.ORG has something to say:

>  You could argue that the atmospheric noise used as a source for the RANDOM.ORG numbers can be viewed as a chaotic but deterministic system. 

Hence, if you knew enough about the processes that cause atmospheric noise (e.g., thunderstorms) you could potentially predict the numbers generated by RANDOM.ORG.

However, to do this, you would probably need knowledge of the position and velocity of every single molecule in the planet's weather systems.

This is of course infeasible, and the inaccuracy of weather forecasts is a good example of how difficult it is to give even a rough estimate of the behaviour of weather systems.

For this reason, it is impractical to predict random numbers from RANDOM.ORG, even for a determinist. A similar case (on a different scale) could be made for random number generators based on lava lamps.

**Regarding radioactive decay**

Radioactive decay is a random process.

It is impossible to predict when a particular radioactive nucleus will decay.

_How it works?_

By measuring 4 atoms. If, for example, atom A decays first, "1" is generated; otherwise, "0" is generated

Therefore, the number ranging from 0 - 255 (8 bit)

_How I convert to the range of 0-20?_

if the number is bigger than 20 and smaller than (or equal to) 200, divide the integer by 10, then round it.

if the number bigger than 200, remove the first number and divide the number by 10, then round it.
